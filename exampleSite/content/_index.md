# Building a Quality Department for Regulatory-Grade AI Products: Lessons from a Product & Engineering Organization

As scientists and engineers we are driven to create products that solve meaningful problems. But in healthcare, solving problems isn’t enough—you also need to meet the rigorous demands of regulators to ensure your product reaches patients safely and effectively. No matter how innovative or effective your solution is, it won’t see the light of day without rigorous adherence to regulatory standards. Here’s what we’ve learned along the way.

## Regulatory and Quality: The Unsung Heroes of Innovation

Quality and Regulatory Affairs is the misunderstood hero of the healthcare universe. To many business leaders and engineers, they seem like the villains—slowing things down, piling on paperwork, and stifling innovation. But they’re not the enemy. They’re the architects of trust.
In healthcare, trust is everything. Regulators, physicians, and patients need to believe in your product’s safety, efficacy, and reliability. Without Quality and Regulatory teams, even the best AI Product won’t make it past the front door of the healthcare ecosystem.

## The Role of Regulatory in AI Product Development
Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or European Notified Bodies, exist to safeguard patients by ensuring products are safe and effective. As a manufacturer, your job is to:
1.	Prove that your development processes are reproducible and predictable.
2.	Demonstrate with evidence that your product meets high standards of safety and efficacy.
This applies not just to AI models but to every component of your product. In intermediate and high-risk product classes, both the product and the development processes must be certified before you can launch. 

## Framing the Right Questions
When establishing quality systems, the mindset you adopt matters. The two questions that you may ask yourself:
-	How do we design our manufacturing or software development to meet regulatory requirements?
-	How do we design our processes to create and maintain the best possible product, measured by safety and efficacy?

While these questions seem aligned, they often lead to different approaches. In my experience, manufacturers and regulatory consultants typically default to the first strategy—modelling processes based on assumptions of what will satisfy regulators, sometimes at the expense of product quality. The irony? Regulators don’t intend to enforce processes that undermine product quality. However, defining universal regulations for a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics is an iintractable challenge. Technology always outpaces regulation, leaving regulators in a constant game of catch-up. 

## How to get started
For any healthcare product, the quality journey starts with understanding the standards that apply. Instead of drowning in hundreds of pages of standards, we focused on mastering their principles. Tools like OpenRegulatory’s Wizard were a lifesaver, highlighting the most relevant sections and providing templates for SOPs and records.

## Documentation: Part of the Product, Not an Afterthought
SOPs, records, and technical files aren’t just “paperwork”—they are integral parts of your product. They provide the evidence needed to show that your product does what it claims to do, safely and effectively.
We made a deliberate effort to treat documentation with the same care as our AI models, infrastructure, and user interfaces. SOPs were written to be clear and concise, ensuring that every team member—not just regulatory experts—could understand and follow them.
By involving our scientists and engineers in defining these processes, we ensured they were practical, effective, and aligned with how we worked.

## Balancing Regulatory Demands with Product Development Speed
One of our biggest challenges was maintaining the agility of a startup while meeting regulatory requirements. Traditional compliance processes felt slow and cumbersome, but modern tools helped us strike the right balance.
For example, Ketryx integrated seamlessly with tools like GitHub and Jira, automatically generating regulatory records from existing artifacts like dependency files or tickets. This approach reduced the documentation burden on engineers and allowed us to focus on building the product.
For us, Ketryx transformed compliance from a bottleneck into an enabler, helping us ship faster while staying audit-ready.

## Hiring the Right Team
Regulatory and quality tasks can quickly overwhelm product teams. If you don’t have the bandwidth to handle them yourself, you’ll face a critical decision: hire in-house or rely on consultants.
Here’s what we learned:
•	Consultants are useful for short-term needs or when you’re unable to find the right talent. However, their impact is often limited, and their incentive structures (e.g., hourly billing) may not align with your goals.
•	In-house hires bring lasting value. A dedicated Quality and Regulatory Manager can embed deeply into your organization, ensure knowledge retention, and align processes with your product vision.
We chose to hire, and it made all the difference. For startups looking to hire in this space, Digital Health Jobs is a great resource for finding talent passionate about healthcare innovation.

## Lessons Learned
Building a quality department isn’t just about compliance—it’s about creating a foundation for trust, safety, and excellence. Here are our key takeaways:
1.	Start with product excellence: Focus on building a product that’s safe, effective, and reliable. Compliance will follow.
2.	Use the right tools: Platforms like Ketryx and OpenRegulatory can save you time and resources while simplifying compliance workflows.
3.	Treat documentation as part of the product: Make it clear, concise, and actionable.
4.	Invest in the right people: Build a team that understands both the regulatory and product development worlds.
At the end of the day, regulatory-grade products aren’t just about meeting requirements, they’re about delivering on the promise of better healthcare. By embedding quality into every aspect of your product, you’re not just checking a box; you’re building something that patients, clinicians, and regulators can trust.
